## Description 

This app uses Node.js and its jest/inquirer packages to allow the user to generate a 'team profile page' for their company. When all prompts are finished, the final product delivers a set of basic 'business cards' by generating an HTML file to be used with the included CSS stylesheet.

## Installation

First, clone the repository into the desired directory. Next, navigate to that directory in the command line (example: ~/project-folder/team-profile-generator). Now, run the Node.js command 'npm install' to install all required packages shown in the package.json file. If your install request was successful, run the command 'node index' to run the program.

## Usage

After successful installation, run the command 'node index.js' to run the program. You will be prompted to fill out information for one team manager and any number of Engineers and Interns. Once you have finished filling out the prompts and select that you are finished adding team members, an index.html file will have been written to the /dist/ folder alongside its style.css file. Finally, add these two files to the directory where you intend to host the files for your team site and publish it to the internet.
